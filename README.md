# Nutrifit

This project consists of developing an application that helps the user to keep a journal of their diet and exercise. The user will log what they eat every day, in terms of food items and the application will determine nutrient and calory intake as well as food groups represented in the meals, based on the Canadian Nutrient File (CNF). The application aims at helping the user to break down their calory intake in food groups and monitor how well the align with the Canada Food Guide. Using the logged exercise data, the application will calculate the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), based on which the application can calculate the calories burnt based on various levels of exercise. Based on this, the user can find out how much weight they can lose based on their diet and exercise. The user can visualize different data over different time periods for better understanding.

In the exerciseLog-implementation zip, it is necessary to import the external JARs into the project before being able to test it, or else it will give errors for the calenderWindow as well as the connector to the database
